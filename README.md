# üß¨ Breast Cancer Prediction ML

An end-to-end machine learning project that predicts breast cancer diagnosis using multiple classification algorithms.  
The goal is to assist early detection and improve diagnostic accuracy through data-driven insights.

---

## üìò Overview
This project explores the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) dataset**, applying several supervised learning algorithms to classify tumors as *malignant* or *benign*.  
The workflow includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and comparison.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming:** Python (Jupyter Notebook)
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Techniques:** Classification, Feature Scaling, Hyperparameter Tuning, Model Evaluation

---

## üß† ML Models Implemented
- Logistic Regression  
- Random Forest Classifier  
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)  
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- Gradient Boosting  

Each model was evaluated using:
- Accuracy  
- Precision, Recall, F1-Score  
- ROC-AUC  
- Confusion Matrix

## üîç Project Workflow
1. **Data Preprocessing**  
   - Handled missing values and outliers.  
   - Scaled numerical features using StandardScaler.  
   - Encoded target labels (Malignant = 1, Benign = 0).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Visualized class distribution and key features.  
   - Analyzed correlations using heatmaps and pair plots.  

3. **Model Training and Evaluation**  
   - Trained multiple classification algorithms.  
   - Compared models using AUC, accuracy, and confusion matrices.  

4. **Results & Insights**  
   - Random Forest and SVM achieved the highest diagnostic accuracy.  
   - Feature importance analysis highlighted *mean radius* and *mean texture* as critical predictors.
